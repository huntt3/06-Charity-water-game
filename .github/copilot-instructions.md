Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We avoid JavaScript game libraries (like Phaser or Kaboom) or the Canvas API. Stick to DOM-based JavaScript.

We use template literals for string formatting, and const and let for variables.

We use || and && in conditionals when necessary.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code, especially when debugging.

We use matter.js for physics simulations.

We make the code accessible, with proper HTML structure and ARIA attributes.
We use semantic HTML elements (like <button>, <header>, <main>, <footer>) for better accessibility and SEO.
We use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles in HTML.

We use responsive design principles to ensure the game works well on different screen sizes.
We use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout to create responsive designs.
We ensure the game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
